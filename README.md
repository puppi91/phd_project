This work is the PhD research of Riccardo Puppi, conducted at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) under the Chair of Numerical Modelling and Simulation (MNS). The dissertation is titled "Stabilized Isogeometric Discretizations on Trimmed and Union Geometries, and Weak Imposition of the Boundary Conditions for Darcy Flow."

The repository includes the LaTeX source code of the manuscript as well as the MATLAB code used for the numerical experiments. To run the MATLAB code, you will need to download and install the GEOPDES package, which is specifically designed for Isogeometric Analysis in MATLAB. You can find it at: http://rafavzqz.github.io/geopdes/.

I hope this work proves to be a valuable resource for others in the field.

Best regards, Riccardo
